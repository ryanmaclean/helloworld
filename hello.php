# This would have been PHP 4, and I desperately wished we could afford the Zend engine at our host, Magma. 
# I spent WAY too much time in the PHP world, first with OSCommerce, then WordPress. I never did learn PHP5. 
# Also, Gedit would have been my editor at this time, again in SuSE 8. On our server, I used Nano, fearing Vi!
# (Emacs was not available) At some point I signed up for Dreamhost, where I loved using FTP and local text editors
# to live-update my sites.
