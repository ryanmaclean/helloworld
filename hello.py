# Though I had played with python scripts when setting up splogs, the first time I really had to write it was to help 
# with Jenkins jobs. These were inline, and probably not the right approach, even at the time, but I got pretty 
# far with it. 
# This would also mark the first time I started using 'env' in my shebangs, somehow.
