# I still don't think I knew the difference between sh and bash at this point, though I knew I hated Korn shell
# and wished I could have Bash on the unix workstations in HP-UX or Solaris. Once I found the echo syntax, 
# I used it forever instead of printf. This would have been Bash 2. 

echo hello world
