// Finally, a syntax I like! Go feels like a mishmash of C, Java and Bash syntax to me. It's not for everyone,
// but I have been enjoying it. Not using this for anything other than dirty API calls for popular SaaS services, writing
// boilerplate tests for Terraform modules, but even that might be short-lived. Handy to be able to put in a Lambda/Function.
