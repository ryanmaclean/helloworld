/* Though I had made animations and such while at UNB on the G4, I didn't really play with any of the code
until I moved to Halifax, and met a friend who was taking a Flash course at NSCAD. I started doing silly
projects in ActionScript based on magazines I bought and could barely afford that came with CDs full of 
sample code.
