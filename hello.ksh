# I didn't understand the hashbang back then, and this would have been Korn shell at least to start with
# I loved how simple the files were. During this era I would have been refurbishing Sun and HP-PA boxes, 
# As well as parting out used Pentium 2 and 3 slot 1 computers. This is when I found linux, which I used as 
# an OS to test hardware, nothing more. I ended up building a custom distro using Linux From Scratch later
# on, and these scripts would run things like burn-ins and memory tests.
