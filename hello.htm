<!-- I bought an HTML3 to HTML4 skill-up book because it was cheap, and built on that knowledge to get things done
until I finally was able to afford the O'Reilly HTML4 book. I treasured that book. To this day, still have fond memories!
Most of what I was doing at this time was cobbling together OSCommerce modules to create portions of our CRM/POS/Ecommerce
site. Nothing spectacular, and a lot less fun than Flash, but it was neat being able to solve real business needs
for our small store where I was the cofounder (there were only two of us for a good while). -->
