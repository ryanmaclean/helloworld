# Ruby was possibly my favourite way to write shells scripts, and somehow I've mostly forgotten the syntax. 
# I was working as both an Apple bench tech at the time, as well as an ASCA-certified consultant. 
# These scripts would kick off Xraid tasks, domain joins and run other scripts. I may have also 
# dabbled with Rails, but honestly wasn't great at it. This is also around the same time I started
# using emoticons in emails, having only ever used them in IRC, but realizing the benefit they added.
# Microsoft Exchange used to drive me crazy with the 'J' it would substitute for ':)'.

puts 'Hello world :)'
