# Hello World History
A collection of Hello Worlds I once wrote while learning things, from memory for the most part :)

Also serves as a history of things I've done, tech I've worked with, as I've scripted my way through being a startup founder, bench tech, consultant, systems engineer, release engineer. 

I first started with Amiga Basic in ~1987. I'm pretty sure Basic and Batch on DOS 5 was next when 286 laptops came out. Then came Asymetrix Toolbook, which was a type of Visual Basic. 

In university I learned Java, Emacs Lisp, SQL, C++ (which I loathed at the time). At the student paper I learned ActionScript as we had Macromedia Flash on my photo editing compter (pretty sure that was a G4). In my spare time I wrote EggDrop bots for IRC in TCL, which continued for quite some time. 

I had a 'startup' computer retail shop / repair place where I learned HTML, DHTML, CSS and PHP for the OSCommerce stuff I was hacking on, and Perl to run scripts on the Sun servers where it was hosted (Magma, around year 2000). I wrote some shell scripts to do small things, these were either Korn shell (HP-UX) or Bash (SuSE on Pentium 2s). 

Once I moved to Vancouver, I did a fair amound of Visual Basic .Net, but usually just debugging and patching things we had at ECL. 

In 2006 I (re-)learned Bash scripts and starting using Ruby on MacBooks running Tiger and xServes, and though I did a smaterring of Rails, only a tiny bit of Javascript. 

Once I became a Windows consultant, PowerShell and VBScript became the tools of choice for automating tasks. I also ended up using Batch files and AutoIt for SoftGrid work for a local healthcare authority, then eventually Bash yet again for VMware server automation. 

Joined a company that ran Java at scale, and ended up debugging Java code in production. Edited Python scripts we used for builds in Jenkins. 

More recently learned a bit about .net Core and C#, React, Angular, Node while reviewing code our consultants wrote. Started learning Go and Rust on the side for fun, which was a surprise to me. Starting using Emacs again, looking at Emacs Lisp.
