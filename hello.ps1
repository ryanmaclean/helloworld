<# I used and abused powershell scripts found around the net until I got official training in the form
of EA credits from Microsoft redeamed at Global Knowledge for PowerShell 1, 2 and 4 courses. 
I would typically send these to remote computers over psexec, and author everything in PowerShell ISE.
These days I end up using it whenever I need to bootstrap something on Windows.
