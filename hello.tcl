# The great thing about the CCNA class is that we touched on TCL, and that I was a raving IRC addict by the year 2000
# having used it while in junior high, high school and most importantly while in Japan. I was ^^Oo_oO^^ on undernet. 
# I won't claim to have invented the whole ASCII face as username trend, but I definitely hadn't seen it before and
# thought I was pretty clever!

# TCL on Cisco devices didn't interest me at all, I didn't even use a router at home, just internet straight in
# to a Mandrake box! Similar to the SQL problem, I didn't have a router or router sim in university, this was all theory
# EggDrops let me write code and test them in IRC, exposing my public IP to the world. What a time to live!
# Around this time I had discovered textfiles.com and thought mispellings were funny after readin das blinkenlights.
